# fiancial_app

A new Flutter project.

I have build a basic financial application.
Where we can add the transcation, to track our daily expenses & incomes.
I have build this app on emulator. So to launch this we can use emulator or can use mobile device using usb debugging.
In the application I have created three screens:
1. Dashboard Screen:
    This screen shows the total Income, Expenses & also shows Net balence remaining.
    It shows the pie chart for the categories of the the expense in the transactions.
2. Transactions display Screen:
    It shows the entered transactions details in the list.
    There is an option to edit and delete the transaction.
3. Add & Edit transaction:
    In this screen we can add or edit the transactions in the list.
    We can add Transaction by entering title, amount, transcation type(income, expense), Category & Date.
